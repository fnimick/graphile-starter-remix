        Welcome to the PostGraphile starter

      <div>
        This project can serve as a basis for your own project. We've added many
        features that most projects require, but you're free to remove them or
        replace them with whatever you need.

          Please read the next few sections before continuing.
        </span>
      </div>

      <h4 class="text-xl">Sveltekit</h4>
      <div>
        We use Sveltekit to serve the Svelte app. This gives us server-side
        rendering, routing, bundle splitting, hot reloading, and much more. <br
        />
        Please note that unlike the standard Graphile Starter or the Remix variant,
        Sveltekit is <b>not</b> served by the main NodeJS backend. This allows you
        to deploy it separately via optimized hosting.
      </div>

      <h4 class="text-xl">Page hangs: development only</h4>
      <div>
        If the page hangs (or shows a connection error) this is likely because
        the Svelte server has encountered an issue. Please check your Vite
        terminal and reload the page.
      </div>

      <h4 class="text-xl">Emails</h4>
      <div>
        <strong>
          In development we don't send any emails to real email addresses
        </strong>
        , instead all emails are sent to{" "}
        <a href="http://ethereal.email"> ethereal.email </a>{" "}
        where you can browse them. Keep an eye on the terminal; when an email is
        triggered the server will log a URL to view the email.
      </div>

      <h4 class="text-xl">
        <a href={`${PUBLIC_ROOT_URL}/graphiql`}>
          Graph<em>i</em>QL
        </a>
      </h4>
      <div>
        You can browse the GraphQL API and even issue GraphQL queries using the
        built in Graph<em>i</em>QL interface located at{" "}
        <a href={`${PUBLIC_ROOT_URL}/graphiql`}>
          <code>/graphiql</code>
        </a>
        .

        </a>
      </h4>
      <div>
        This entry point creates an Express.js server and installs a number of
        middlewares, including PostGraphile.
      </div>

      <h4 class="text-xl">Initial migration</h4>
      <div>
        We use <code>graphile-migrate</code> in this project to manage database
        migrations; this allows you to change the database very rapidly by just
        editing the current migration file:{" "}
        <code>migrations/current.sql</code>. This file should be written in an
        idempotent manner so that it can be ran repeatedly without causing
        issues.
      </div>
      <div>
        We've committed the first migration for you (which builds the user
        system), but should you wish to customize this user system the easiest
        way is to run <code>yarn db uncommit</code> which will undo this initial
        migration and move its content back to current.sql for you to modify.
        Please see{" "}
        <a href="https://github.com/graphile/migrate/blob/main/README.md">
          the graphile-migrate documentation
        </a>
        .
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          <b>WARNING</b>: <code>graphile-migrate</code> is experimental, you may
          want to find a different migration solution before putting it into production
          (your sponsorship will help make this project stable faster).
        </p>
      </div>

      <h4 class="text-xl">isAdmin</h4>
      <div>
        The <code>isAdmin</code> flag doesn't do anything in this starter, but you
        can use it in your own applications should you need it.
      </div>

      <h4 class="text-xl">What now?</h4>
      <div>
        To get started, click "Sign in" at the top right, then choose "Create
        One" to create a new account.
      </div>
      <div>
        When you're happy, you can add database changes to{" "}
        <code>current.sql</code> and see them reflected in the GraphiQL
        interface at{" "}
        <a href={`${PUBLIC_ROOT_URL}/graphiql`}> /graphiql </a>
        .
      </div>

      <h3 class="text-2xl">Further notes</h3>

      <div>
        <span class="italic">You can read this later</span>. The important
        things were above; below is additional information worth a read when
        you're done experimenting.
      </div>

      <h4 class="text-xl">Making it yours</h4>
      <div>
        This project isn't intended to be <code>git clone</code>'d; instead you
        should start a new git repository with the code from the latest release:
      </div>
      <ol class="list-inside list-decimal">
        <li>
          Download and extract a zip of the{" "}
          <a href="https://github.com/graphile/starter/releases">
            latest release from GitHub
          </a>
        </li>
        <li>
          In that folder run:
          <ul class="list-inside list-disc indent-2">
            <li>
              <code>git init</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>git add .</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>git commit -m "PostGraphile starter base"</code>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Change the project name in <code>package.json</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          Change the project settings in <code>@app/config/src/index.ts</code>
        </li>
        <li>Replace the README.md file</li>
        <li>Commit as you usually would</li>
      </ol>
      <div>
        We also advise addressing the <code>TODO</code> items in the codebase,
        particularly the one in <code>@app/db/scripts/wipe-if-demo</code>
      </div>

      <h4 class="text-xl">Production readiness</h4>
      <div>
        Remember that disabling GraphiQL does not prevent people from issuing
        arbitrary GraphQL queries against your API. Before you ship, be sure to{" "}
        <a href="https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/production/">
          read the Production Considerations
        </a>{" "}
        in the PostGraphile docs. You may consider{" "}
        <a href="https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/pricing/">
          going Pro
        </a>{" "}
        as one option for protecting your PostGraphile API; another is to use "stored
        operations" (a.k.a. "persisted queries").
      </div>

      <h4 class="text-xl">Realtime</h4>
      <div>
        We've configured PostGraphile with <code>@graphile/pg-pubsub</code> to enable
        realtime events from the DB; and Houdini is configured to consume them. For
        example, if you register with email/password you may notice the red dot at
        the top right indicating that you need to verify your email. If you verify
        your email in another tab (or even another browser) you should notice that
        this dot disappears. Realtime ✨🌈
      </div>

      <h4 class="text-xl">Server-side rendering (SSR)</h4>
      <div>
        If you disable JS and reload the page you should see the content is
        still displayed (this "server-side rendering" is important to ensuring
        that your users have the best low-latency experience of your website,
        and that the majority of search engines can index its content).
      </div>

      <h4 class="text-xl">Duplicate emails</h4>
      <div>
        To prevent people blocking legitimate users from registering, we only
        prevent the same email address being used multiple times when it has
        been verified by someone. It's up to your application to turn features
        off/etc when the user does not have any verified email addresses (should
        you desire this).
      </div>

      <h4 class="text-xl">Email in production</h4>
      <div>
        We've configured the project to use Amazon SES to send emails in
        production (you will need to create the relevant resources and provide
        the relevant secrets to use this); however it can easily be reconfigured
        to use your email transport service of choice.
      </div>

      <h4 class="text-xl">Validation</h4>
      <div>
        We use Zod for client-side and server-side form validation, with client
        error checking provided via <a href="https://felte.dev/">Felte</a>.
        We've shown how to connect server-side errors into the form validation,
        for example try registering a new account using the email address of an
        account{" "}
        <strong>that has already been verified</strong>.
      </div>

      <h4 class="text-xl">One-time clone: no such thing as breaking changes</h4>
      <div>
        It's expected that you'll do a one-time clone of this project to base
        your project off, and that you will not keep your project up to date
        with this one. As such, we can make any changes we like to this project
        without breaking your project.
      </div>
